# Insertion Sort in C

This project demonstrates the **Insertion Sort** algorithm implemented in the C programming language.  
Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the sorted array one element at a time.

---

## ‚úÖ Features
- Implements `insertionSort()` to sort an integer array in ascending order.
- Includes `printArray()` function to display the array before and after sorting.
- Provides a complete example in the `main()` function.

---

## üìÇ How It Works
1. Starts from the second element in the array.
2. Compares the element (`key`) with elements in the sorted portion of the array.
3. Shifts larger elements one position to the right to create space.
4. Inserts `key` in its correct position.
5. Repeats until the array is sorted.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### **Compile the program:**
gcc inserttion.c -o inserttion

## Run the program
```bash
./insertion
